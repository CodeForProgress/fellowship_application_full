    <p>We'd like to know how you're thinking about the role of this program in your personal, work, and community life.</p>

    <p>Please complete the questions below. We don't intend for your answers to be essay length, and in fact we feel that a good answer does not need to be longer than three sentences (the ability to give brief explanations is an important skill in coding), but we've left you space to write as much as you'd like. All questions are required unless marked "optional."</p>
